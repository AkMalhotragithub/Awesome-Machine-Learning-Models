# Handwritten Number Detection Project

### Goal
The goal is to create a deep learning project which will recognize the handwritten numbers and detect them with an accuracy of more than 85%

### Dataset
The dataset used here is from MNIST.
The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.


# Models Used #
1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
