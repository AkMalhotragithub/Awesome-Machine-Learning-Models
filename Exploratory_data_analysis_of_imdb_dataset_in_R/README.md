# Movie Analysis and Recommendation

# Introduction

IMDB is a popular website for rating films and series. Everyone always go there if they want to watch something new and many users trust it's rankings. The data is about most popular 7k Films and series on IMDB with rates, the data is ideal for Exploratory Data Analysis and I also thought of using regression to predict rate. It contains following columns: name, year of release, votes, rating, duration, genre, certificates, type of content such as violence, profanity, alcohol, etc.

## Problem Statement and Novelty

Since there is no universal way to claim the goodness of a movie, one could rely on the parameters like name, year of release, votes, rating, duration, genre, certificates, type of content such as violence, profanity, alcohol, etc. This would help us to predict whether an upcoming movie is good or bad on the basis of the mentioned parameters.

## Methodology

The methodology that I was thinking was to use Divide and Conquer approach. I tried the best algorithm to identify the tasks that could be divided into independent tasks that could be worked upon by us in parallel. As there are many parameters, working on different parameters and plots regarding the analysis in order to get useful information was needed. Also the working methodology will be to build models like linear regression to see the trends for the dataset.
