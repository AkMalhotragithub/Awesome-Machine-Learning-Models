# Movie Analysis and Recommendation

# Introduction

IMDB is a popular website for rating films and series. Everyone always go there if they want to watch something new and many users trust it's rankings. The data is about most popular 7k Films and series on IMDB with rates, the data is ideal for Exploratory Data Analysis and I also thought of using regression to predict rate. It contains following columns: name, year of release, votes, rating, duration, genre, certificates, type of content such as violence, profanity, alcohol, etc.

## Problem Statement and Novelty

Since there is no universal way to claim the goodness of a movie, one could rely on the parameters like name, year of release, votes, rating, duration, genre, certificates, type of content such as violence, profanity, alcohol, etc. This would help us to predict whether an upcoming movie is good or bad on the basis of the mentioned parameters.

## Methodology

The methodology that I was thinking was to use Divide and Conquer approach. I tried the best algorithm to identify the tasks that could be divided into independent tasks that could be worked upon by us in parallel. As there are many parameters, working on different parameters and plots regarding the analysis in order to get useful information was needed. Also the working methodology will be to build models like linear regression to see the trends for the dataset.

## What is an RMD file?

An RMD file is an R Markdown file created using RStudio, an open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the R programming language. It contains YAML metadata, Markdown-formatted plain text, and chunks of R code that, when rendered using RStudio, combine to form a sophisticated data analysis document.

## How to run the RMD file?

1. Download the RMD file from the repository.
2. Open the RMD file in RStudio.
3. Click on the "Knit" button to run the RMD file.
4. The output will be generated in the same folder as the RMD file.
5. The output will be in the form of an HTML file by default.
6. You can also change the output format to PDF or Word.
7. The output will be generated in the same folder as the RMD file.
8. The extra libraries will be installed as you run the RMD file.
9. The file is just like a python ipynb file, you can run the code and see the output.
